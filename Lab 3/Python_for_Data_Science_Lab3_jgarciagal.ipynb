        "We call the numbers operands and the maths symbols, in this case addition, are called\n",

        "In this case the operands are given by – and *.\n",
        "We can also perform division with the forward slash.\n",
        "25 divided by 5 is 5. 25 divided by 6 is approximately 4.167.\n",
        "In Python 3, the version we will be using in this course, both will result in a float.\n",
        "We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded.\n",
        "Be aware, in some cases, the results are not the same as regular division.\n",
        "Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions.\n",
        "The following operations are in a different order.\n",
        "In both cases, Python performs multiplication, then addition to obtain the final result.\n",
        "There are a lot more operations you can do with Python. Check the labs for more examples.\n",
        "We will also be covering more complex operations throughout the course.\n",
        "The expressions in the parentheses are performed first. We then multiply the result by 60,\n",
        "the result is 1920. Now let’s look at variables.\n",
        "We can use variables to store values, in this case, we assign a value of 1 to the variable\n",

        "is much shorter. The code performs the same task.\n",
        "You can think of the process like this: when we call the function f1, we pass an input\n",
        "to the function. These values are passed to all those lines of code you wrote.\n",
        "This returns a value; you can use the value. For example, you can input this value to a\n",
        "new function f2. When we call this new function f2, the value\n",
        "is passed to another set of lines of code. The function returns a value.\n",
        "The process is repeated passing the values to the function you call.\n",
        "You can save these functions and reuse them, or use other people’s functions.\n",
        "Python has many built-in functions; you don't have to know how those functions work internally,\n",
        "but simply what task those functions perform. The function len takes in an input of type\n",
        "sequence, such as a string or list, or type collection, such as a dictionary or set, and\n",
        "returns the length of that sequence or collection. Consider the following list.\n",
        "The len function takes this list as an argument, and we assign the result to the variable L.\n",
        "The function determines there are 8 items in the list, then returns the length of the\n",
        "list, in this case, 8. The function sum takes in an iterable like\n",
        "a tuple or list and returns the total of all the elements.\n",
        "Consider the following list. We pass the list into the sum function and\n",
        "assign the result to the variable S. The function determines the total of all the\n",
        "elements, then returns it, in this case, the value is 70.\n",
        "There are two ways to sort a list. The first is using the function sorted.\n",
        "We can also use the list method sort. Methods are similar to functions.\n",
        "Let's use this as an example to illustrate the difference.\n",
        "The function sorted Returns a new sorted list or tuple.\n",
        "Consider the list album ratings. We can apply the function sorted to the list\n",
        "album ratings and get a new list sorted album rating.\n",
        "The result is a new sorted list. If we look at the list album ratings, nothing\n",
        "has changed. Generally, functions take an input, in this\n",
        "case, a list. They produce a new output, in this instance, a sorted list.\n",
        "If we use the method sort, the list album ratings will change and no new list will be\n",
        "created. Let's use this diagram to help illustrate\n",
        "the process. In this case, the rectangle represents the\n",
        "list album ratings. When we apply the method sort to the list,\n",
        "the list album rating changes. Unlike the previous case, we see that the\n",
        "list album rating has changed. In this case, no new list is created.\n",
        "Now that we have gone over how to use functions in Python, let’s see how to build our own\n",
        "functions. We will now get you started on building your\n",
        "own functions in python. This is an example of a function in python\n",
        "that returns its input value + 1. To define a function, we start with the keyword\n",
        "def. The name of the function should be descriptive\n",
        "of what it does. We have the function formal parameter \"A\"\n",
        "in parentheses. Followed by a colon.\n",
        "We have a code block with an indent, for this case, we add 1 to \"A\" and assign it to B.\n",
        "We return or output the value for b. After we define the function, we can call\n",
        "it. The function will add 1 to 5 and return a 6. We can call the function again; this time\n",
        "assign it to the variable \"c\" The value for 'c' is 11.\n",
        "Let's explore this further. Let's go over an example when you call a function.\n",
        "It should be noted that this is a simplified model of Python, and Python does not work\n",
        "like this under the hood. We call the function giving it an input, 5.\n",
        "It helps to think of the value of 5 as being passed to the function.\n",
        "Now the sequences of commands are run, the value of \"A\" is 5.\n",
        "\"B\" would be assigned a value of 6. We then return the value of b, in this case,\n",
        "as b was assigned a value of 6, the function returns a 6.\n",
        "If we call the function again, the process starts from scratch; we pass in an 8.\n",
        "The subsequent operations are performed. Everything that happened in the last call\n",
        "will happen again with a different value of \"A\"\n",
        "The function returns a value, in this case, 9.\n",
        "Again, this is just a helpful analogy. Let’s try and make this function more complex.\n",
        "It's customary to document the function on the first few lines; this tells anyone who\n",
        "uses the function what it does. This documentation is surrounded in triple\n",
        "quotes. You can use the help command on the function\n",
        "to display the documentation as follows. This will printout the function name and the\n",
        "documentation. We will not include the documentation in the\n",
        "rest of the examples. A function can have multiple parameters.\n",
        "The function mult multiplies two numbers; in other words, it finds their product.\n",
        "If we pass the integers 2 and 3, the result is a new integer.\n",
        "If we pass the integer 10 and the float 3.14, the result is a float 31.4.\n",
        "If we pass in the integer two and the string “Michael Jackson,” the string Michael\n",
        "Jackson is repeated two times. This is because the multiplication symbol\n",
        "can also mean repeat a sequence. If you accidentally multiply an integer and\n",
        "a String instead of two integers, you won’t get an error.\n",
        "Instead, you will get a String, and your program will progress, potentially failing later because\n",
        "you have a String where you expected an integer. This property will make coding simpler, but\n",
        "you must test your code more thoroughly. In many cases a function does not have a return\n",
        "statement. In these cases, Python will return the special\n",
        "“None” object. Practically speaking, if your function has\n",
        "no return statement, you can treat it as if the function returns nothing at all.\n",
        "The function MJ simply prints the name 'Michael Jackson’.\n",
        "We call the function. The function prints “Michael Jackson.”\n",
        "Let's define the function “No work” that performs no task.\n",
        "Python doesn’t allow a function to have an empty body, so we can use the keyword pass,\n",
        "which doesn’t do anything, but satisfies the requirement of a non-empty body.\n",
        "If we call the function and print it out, the function returns a None.\n",
        "In the background, if the return statement is not called, Python will automatically return\n",
        "a None. It is helpful to view the function No Work\n",
        "with the following return statement. Usually, functions perform more than one task.\n",
        "This function prints a statement then returns a value.\n",

        "Finally, the function returns the value of b, in this case, 3.\n",
        "We can use loops in functions. This function prints out the values and indexes\n",

        "The values of i and s are updated. The print statement is reached.\n",
        "Similarly, the next values of the list and index are printed.\n",
        "The process is repeated. The values of i and s are updated.\n",

        "Every object has the following: a type, internal representation, a set of functions called\n",

        "making a new class. There are other special functions in Python\n",

        "the vector 'v' with two components. In vector addition, we create a new vector in this case\n",
        "'z'. The first component of 'z' is the addition of the first component of vectors 'u' and\n",
        "'v'. Similarly, the second component is the sum of the second components of 'u' and 'v'.\n",
        "This new vector 'z' is now a linear combination of the vector 'u' and 'v'.\n",
        "Representing vector addition with line segment or arrows is helpful. The first vector is\n",
        "represented in red; the vector will point in the direction of the two components.\n",
        "The first component of the vector is one; as a result, the arrow is offset one unit from\n",
        "the origin in the horizontal direction. The second component is 0. We represent this component\n",
        "in the vertical direction, as this component is zero the vector does not point in the horizontal\n",
        "direction. We represent the second vector in blue. The first component is zero, therefore,\n",
        "the arrow does not point in the horizontal direction. The second component is one.\n",
        "As a result, the vector points in the vertical direction one unit. When we add the vector\n",
        "'u' and 'v' we get the new vector 'z'. We add the first component, this corresponds\n",
        "to the horizontal direction. We also add the second component. It's helpful to use the\n",
        "tip-to-tail method when adding vectors, placing the tail of vector 'v' on the tip of vector 'u'.\n",
        "The new vector 'z' is constructed by connecting the base of the first vector 'u'\n",
        "with the tail of the second 'v'. The following 3 lines of code will add the\n",
        "two lists and place the result in the list 'z'.\n",
        "We can also perform vector addition with one line of numpy code. It would require multiple\n",
        "lines to perform vector subtraction on two lists, as shown on the right side of the screen.\n",
        "In addition, the numpy code will run much faster. This is important if you have lots\n",
        "of data. We can also perform vector subtraction by\n",
        "changing the addition sign to a subtraction sign. It would require multiple lines to perform\n",
        "vector subtraction on two lists, as shown on the right side of the screen.\n",
        "Vector multiplication with a Scalar is another commonly performed operation. Consider the\n",
        "vector 'y', each component is specified by a different color. We simply multiply the\n",
        "vector by a scalar value, in this case, 2. Each component of the vector is multiplied\n",
        "by 2; in this case, each component is doubled. We can use the line segment or arrows to visualize\n",
        "what’s going on. The original vector y is in purple. After multiplying it by a scalar\n",
        "value of 2, the vector is stretched out by two units, as shown in red. The new vector\n",
        "is twice as long in each direction. Vector multiplication with a scalar only requires\n",
        "one line of code using Numpy. It would require multiple lines to perform the same task as\n",
        "shown with python lists, as shown on the right side of the screen. In addition, the operation\n",
        "would also be much slower. Hadamard product is another widely used operation\n",
        "in data science. Consider the following two vectors 'u' and 'v'. The Hadamard product\n",
        "of 'u' and 'v' is a new vector 'z'. The first component of 'z' is the product of the first\n",
        "element of 'u' and 'v'. Similarly, the second component is the product of the second element\n",
        "of 'u' and 'v'. The resultant vector consists of the entrywise product of 'u' and 'v'.\n",
        "We can also perform Hadamard product with 1 line of code in Numpy. It would require\n",
        "multiple lines to perform Hadamard product on two lists as shown on the right side of\n",
        "the screen. The dot product is another widely used operation\n",
        "in data science, consider the vector 'u' and 'v'. The dot product is a single number given\n",
        "by the following term and represents how similar two vectors are. We multiply the first component\n",
        "from 'v' and 'u'. We then multiply the second component and add the result together.\n",
        "The result is a number that represents how similar the two vectors are.\n",
        "We can also perform dot product using the numpy function \"dot” and assign it the variable\n",
        "\"result” as follows. Consider the array 'u'. The array contains\n",
        "the following elements. If we add a scalar value to the array, numpy will add that value\n",
        "to each element. This property is known as broadcasting.\n",
        "A universal function is a function that operates on ndarrays.\n",
        "We can apply a universal function to a Numpy array. Consider the arrays 'a'. We can calculate\n",
        "the mean or average value of all the elements in 'a' using the method \"mean”. This corresponds\n",
        "to the average of all the elements. In this case the result is zero.\n",
        "There are many other functions, for example, consider the numpy arrays 'b'. We can find\n",
        "the maximum value using the method 5. We see the largest value is 5. Therefore, the method\n",
        "max returns a 5. We can use numpy to create functions that\n",
        "map numpy arrays to new numpy arrays. Let's implement some code on the left side of the\n",
        "screen and use the right side of the screen to demonstrate what's going on. We can access\n",
        "the value of pi in Numpy as follows. We can create the following numpy array in Radians.\n",
        "This array corresponds to the following vector. We can apply the function \"sine\" to the array\n",
        "x and assign the values to the array y; this applies the sine function to each element\n",
        "in the array. This corresponds to applying the sine function to each component of the\n",
        "vector. The result is a new array y where each value corresponds to a sine function\n",
        "being applied to each element in the array x.\n",
        "A useful function for plotting mathematical functions is \"linespace\". Linespace returns\n",
        "evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. We specify the starting point of the sequence.\n",
        "The ending point of the sequence. The parameter \"num\" indicates the Number of samples to generate,\n",

        "An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other.\n",
        "For example you have your program, you have some data, you have other software components.\n",
        "You use the API to communicate with the API via inputs and outputs.\n",
        "Just like a function, you don’t have to know how the API works, but just its inputs\n",
        "and outputs.\n",
        "Pandas is actually a set of software components, much of which are not even written in Python.\n",
        "You have some data. You have a set of software components.\n",
        "We use the pandas API to process the data by communicating with the other Software Components.\n",
        "Let’s clean up the diagram. When you create a dictionary, and then create\n",
        "a pandas object with the Dataframe constructor, in API lingo, this is an “instance.”\n",
        "The data in the dictionary is passed along to the pandas API.\n",
        "You then use the dataframe to communicate with the API.\n",
        "When you call the method head, the dataframe communicates with the API, displaying the\n",
        "first few rows of the dataframe. When you call the method mean, the API will\n",
        "calculate the mean and return the values.\n",
        "REST APIs are another popular type of API; they allow you to communicate through the\n",
        "internet allowing you to take advantage of resources like storage, access more data,\n",
        "artificial intelligent algorithms, and much more.\n",
        "The RE stands for Representational, the S stands for State, the T stand for Transfer.\n",
        "In rest API’s your program is called the client.\n",

        "There is a set of rules regarding Communication, Input or Request, and Output or Response.\n",
        "Here are some common terms. You or your code can be thought of as a client.\n",
        "The web service is referred to as a resource. The client finds the service via an endpoint.\n",
        "We will review this more in the next section. The client sends requests to the resource\n",

        "HTTP methods are a way of transmitting data over the internet.\n",

        "we would like the service to perform. This operation is transmitted to the webservice\n",
        "via the internet. The service performs the operation.\n",
        "In the similar manner, the webservice returns a response via an HTTP message, where the\n",
        "information is usually returned via a JSON file.\n",
        "This information is transmitted back to the client.\n",
        "Sports data is always changing. This is an excellent application of an API\n",

        "We import the module teams. The method \"get teams\" returns a lists of\n",
        "dictionaries, which have the same keys, but the values depend on the team.\n",
        "The dictionary key id has a unique identifier for each team as a value.\n",
        "To make things easier, we can convert the dictionary to a table.\n",
        "First, we create the function \"one dict,\" to create a dictionary.\n",
